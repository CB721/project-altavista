# Project-altavista
Our dream Project is focusing on 3D model Racing Game which is using one of the most efficient game engine platforms: Playcanvas, Unity, Babylon etc.

The player must get a fun experience: smooth movements, changing obstacles and pleasant sounds effects (ideally authentication option for users and score function). 3D model Objects and high bitrate video experience is what drives us!

We are hoping to achieve a full functional minimalistic Racing Game.
Functionality is a high priority, but a great UI experience is by default!

**User stories:**
1) As a player, I want to hear sound effects as I play to let me know when I do something good or bad.
2) As a player, I want to see different environments and obstacles.
3) As a player, I want to be able to login and see my high scores.
4) As a player, I want to be able to collect items to get a higher score.
