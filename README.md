# Project-altavista
A 3D model racing game using one of the most efficient game engine platforms: Unity.

The player must get a fun experience: smooth movements, changing obstacles and pleasant sounds effects. 

We have achieved a full functional minimalistic racing game.
Functionality of the website and the game are the most important aspects.
